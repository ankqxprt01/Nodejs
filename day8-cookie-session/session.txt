A session is a way to store information about a user across multiple 
requests during their interaction with a web application

How Do Sessions Work?
Client makes a request (e.g., visits login page)
Server creates a session for that client and stores session data on the server
The server sends a session ID to the client, 
usually stored in a cookie (commonly called connect.sid in Express)
Client sends the session ID cookie back with every request
When the session ends or expires, 
the server deletes the stored session data, 
and the client no longer has a valid session ID

 Data Storage     Stored on server                          Stored on client (browser)                   
 Data Size Limit  Larger, depends on server storage         Small (4KB per cookie)                       
 Security         More secure, data not accessible via JS   Vulnerable to XSS if not `httpOnly`          
 Usage            Stores user state, sensitive data         Stores less sensitive info, e.g. preferences
