 Streams are built-in objects in Node.js that let you process data 
 piece-by-piece (chunk by chunk), as it arrives,
 instead of loading everything into memory at once.

 example:
 Instead of reading an entire 5 GB video file into memory 
 before sending it to the user (which would crash your server)

 steps
 Opens the file
 Reads a small chunk (say 64 KB)
 Sends that chunk
 Then reads and sends the next chunk
 Keeps going until done

Like drinking from a straw instead of trying 
to gulp(gatak jao ek sath) the whole glass at once.

absolute vs relative system path
const path = require('path');

console.log('Absolute path:');
console.log(path.resolve('C:\Users\John\Projects\App\demo-video.mp4')); // absolute

console.log('Relative path (resolved from current working directory):');
console.log(path.resolve('videos/demo.mp4')); // relative

CDN links can be considered absolute paths URL's like jquery,bootstrap etc
absolute path have domain name like cdn.jsdelivr.net

relative path do not have domain name
Depend on the current pages location to resolve the path.
