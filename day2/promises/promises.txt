1)A promise is a promise of code execution.
A promise is an object that respresent the eventual compilation or failur
of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

live eg:
suppose u want to order a pizza from swiggy then it will take estimated time
what u will do u will do rest of ur work or u will continue watch for it?

2)the solution to promise is callbackhell
3)the code either executes or fails in both cases subscriber will notify?

Syntax:
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
    // codes
})

resolve and reject are 2 callbacks provided 
by js engine itself they are called.

resolve(value) -> if job finished.
reject(error)  -> if job fails.

promises has 2 properties:
1)state: initially pending,then changes to either
"fulfilled" when resolve is called
"reject" when reject is called

2)result: initally undefined,then changes to value
if resolved(resolve value) or error when rejected(reject error)

you cant call directly promise.state or promise.result it will throw undefined error

difference between 
->fulfilled:
In simple term u order something any how they dint complete ur order & they refunded.
Means ur order is fulfill we settle our accounts
->resolve: means this is ur order enjoy ur meal
->reject: we are sorry

Consumers: .then & catch
