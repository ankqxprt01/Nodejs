1)in 1995 js was used on client-side i.e on browser.
2)html css is not a programming language.where as python java are standalone programming language
3)Js is a programming language which works on browser
4)how u can said programming language on browser?
its a language which has to be converted into a language which has to be understand by computer or 
machine code and that where we have engine between.
It means browser has to inerpret i.e convert jscode into machine code this concept is called 
JAVASCRIPT ENGINE now this engine will convert js code and put in machine code my be with help of
compiler or interpreter
5)so do we have only one js engine no we have multiple browser like chrome,firefox,nestscape safari etc
so these browser use different engines.

6)so 1st engine was spidermonkey is developed at nestscape by creator of brandan 
eich and it was developed in just 10days
so entire language with compiler with engine jsut created in 10days, now we have
chrome which has v8 engine.v8 engine become most popular now it is built in every other browser

7)why v8?
bcoz its directly converting code machine code which makes it faster.as it was growing faster
so they thaught we will not run it on browser will run it everywhere

8)now the question was js can used everywhere?
can we use it on mobile appln,desktop appln or on server?
one of them thaught we use v8 to built run time enviroment that will work on machine
and they named it as Nodejs

9)Nodejs is not programming language its a run time enviroment that 
lets u run js outside ur browser
now using nodejs u can build standalone application

nodejs is js engine which runs ur js on physical machine
what if we can add http component or http module inside nodejs that means 
the moment u have http power means u can use nodejs on server side component
so there are lots of http module or some can downloaded from internet.

so now js can be used on client and can be used on server side with this 
we have concept of full-stack-developement

but do we have framework to build web application in js?
like java framework has spring ,python has django,
what framework do we use in js?
as nodejs is not framework so wee have to use some framework so now we have 3 js
now 
we have nodejs as runtime 
we have express as framework
we have mongodb as database 
we have react to build our U/I 

Which we spell MERN OR MEAN STACK

nodejs has one more thing which is called NPM(node package manager)
for eg:in java when u built appln u use external dependencies
for eg working with database we need connecter in between,or working with files

so in nodejs there are also packages that gives us all modules

in short nodejs is javascript run time enviroment which uses the v8 javascript engine

steps to downlaod nodejs go to chrome search nodejs and just download it

simple code for nodejs create app.js and write below code
var http = require("http");
http.createServer(function(req,res){
    res.write("hello world);
    res.end()

    or 

    //it means whatever i am sending is in html format
    res.writeHead(200,{'Content-Type':'text/html'})
    res.end("hello world")

}).listen(8080)

--------------------------------------------------------------
write node in ur terminal
write
console.log("hello world");
hello world
undefined 
the output will be above

so create any file_name.js and open the file in ur terminal
to run the file type node file_name.js
